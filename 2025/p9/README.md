first part was pretty easy.  Basically try all possible combinations for corners and choose the one
with the largest area

The second half took me a LONG time.  Really simple idea to just use part a and then
verify that the sqaure does not cross any edge.  My logic was wrong SOOO many times
I ended up adding some visualization to help me debug
