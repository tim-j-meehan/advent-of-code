Strategy for part one is pretty basic.  Just grab the max val in the string not includeing the ffinal val.  Then grab the max val from the location of this max to the end of the string

Part 2 takes the same basic approach but requires extra book keeping to make sure we save off enough digits to complete the sequence.
