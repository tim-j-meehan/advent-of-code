This final problem was sort of dissapointing for me.  It is basically a 2d packing problem.  
I started with a brute force'ish algorithm and even coded up a visualization.  I was starting
down the path of finding subsets that would perfectly fill rectangles, I still want to come back
to my original approach.  In the end I just used a simple min max bound to eliminate possible 
packings and it worked.  Not sure if it would work for other datasets, but I suspect this was part of the
authors plan.
